# Airbnb Market Analysis

Using data on Airbnb listings, this study evaluates the influence of conventional economic
model on the sharing economy in the city of San Francisco. 

This project finds that the model
of listing price in this market highly follows the traditional economy models. Better neigh-
bourhood, individual room and higher review scores inevitably result to a higher price. The
key feature of peer-to-peer accommodation, availability of the listings, has no importance to
the price. 

In order to quantify the impact of conventional capital power, this research uses
non-supervised learning and finds out over one third of the listings belong to the commercial
hosts on San Francisco Airbnb platform. The results which are consistent across all models,
shows that Airbnbâ€™s sharing economy depends greatly on conventional economy model in
San Francisco.
